# [Wolf Kill Counter](https://mods.vintagestory.at/wolfkillcountermod)

WolfKillCounter is a Vintage Story mod that enhances gameplay by tracking how many wolves each player has defeated. Every wolf killed (including wolf pups) is recorded, and players can easily view the top wolf hunters through an in-game leaderboard accessible via chat commands.

# Main Features:
Wolf Kill Tracking: Counts total wolf kills and tracks kills individually by player.

Leaderboard Command: Players can type /listWolfKills or /lwk to display the top 5 wolf hunters.

Persistent Statistics: Wolf kill data is automatically saved and loaded, ensuring your achievements persist across server restarts.

Leaderboard Reset: Admins can reset the leaderboard without affecting the total kill count.

Goal System: Players have personal kill goals that increase as they defeat more wolves, with notifications when goals are reached. The server also has a global kill goal, doubling each time itâ€™s achieved.

# Commands:
*/listWolfKills or /lwk: Displays the top 5 players with the highest wolf kill counts and the total number of wolves killed.

*/resetWolfLeaderboard: Resets the leaderboard while maintaining the total wolf kill count (admin-only).

*/serverkillgoal or /skg: Displays the server's kill goal and prints the total server kills.

*/playerkillgoal or /pkg: Displays the player's kill goal and prints the player's total kills.
